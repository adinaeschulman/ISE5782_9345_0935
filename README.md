3D Ray Tracing Engine<br><br>

Mini-Project in Introduction to Software Engineering<br><br>

<b>Overview</b><br>
This project is a 3D Ray Tracing Engine implemented as part of the Mini-Project in Introduction to Software Engineering. The project focuses on software architecture, object-oriented design, and agile development practices, including pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and refactoring.<br><br>

The engine simulates the physical behavior of light rays interacting with a 3D scene, including:<br>
- Light sources (ambient, directional, point, and spotlights)<br>
- Geometries (spheres, planes, triangles, cylinders, etc.)<br>
- Ray-object intersections<br>
- Shadows, reflections, and refractions<br><br>

<b>Technologies Used</b><br>
- Java – Main programming language<br>
- JUnit – Unit testing framework<br>
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD) – Used for structuring the system<br>
- GitHub – Version control and collaboration<br><br>

<b>Project Features</b><br>
- Object-Oriented Scene Modeling – Geometric objects (spheres, planes, polygons, etc.) with intersection logic<br>
- Camera and Ray Construction – Generates primary rays from a virtual camera through a view plane<br>
- Lighting and Shading – Implements Phong lighting model with multiple light sources<br>
- Shadowing, Reflections, and Refractions – Recursive ray tracing for realistic rendering<br>
- Scene Rendering – Generates and saves images with complex light interactions<br><br>

<b>Project Implementation</b><br>
We built the helicopter using basic shapes like cylinders and spheres for the body, rotor, and other components. Each part was carefully positioned and adjusted for realism. Using Test-Driven Development (TDD), we tested and refined the model to ensure everything worked smoothly in the final 3D scene.<br><br>
